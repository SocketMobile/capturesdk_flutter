CaptureJS SDK
=============

CaptureJS
---------
The Socket Mobile CaptureJS SDK is a dependency for React Native Capture SDK.

CaptureJS SDK is also used with a web application running in a browser.

Although it does provide a **Capture()** constructor, it should not be used in the case of a React Native application.
Instead the React Native application should use **CaptureRn()** constructor.

The installation of **CaptureJS** is done automatically when installing the **react-native-capture** NPM package and therefore it does not require anything else to be done.

Aside of the constructor difference and the way of installing **CaptureJS**, everything else can be used.

More information about the CaptureJS API can be found `here <https://docs.socketmobile.com/capturejs/en/latest/connectingDevice.html>`_.
