Welcome to Capture Flutter SDK Documentation
=====================================================

The Capture SDK eases the communication between your application and a Socket
Mobile barcode scanner or NFC/RFID wireless Reader/Writer.

The Capture API provides a basic set of methods and callbacks to manage one or
more Socket Mobile devices.

The Capture SDK for Flutter development is mainly a wrapper around **Capture Flutter 
SDK**. 

If you want an overall presentation, you can jump to :doc:`gettingStarted` which
describes the connection process, and the way Capture interacts with your
application and how to install this Flutter package in your development 
environment.
